# Unreal VR Template C++ Sample

I was disappointed that there was no C++ version of Unreal 4.14's VR template, so I decided to make one.

I have an Oculus Rift, so I made the teleport work more like Robo Rally. There are a bunch of Steam VR things that I did not implement because I do not have a Vive. I'd be happy to accept merge requests.

If you see things that are not to Unreal Engine's coding standard, or know an easier way to accomplish anything please let me know or do a pull request!
